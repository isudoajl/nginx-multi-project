   ```bash
   # Test script to verify error handling
   ./tests/test-error-handling.sh
   ```

4. **Certificate Generation Test** ✅ (Passed on 2025-06-22)
   ```bash
   # Test script to verify certificate generation
   ./tests/test-cert-generation.sh
   ```

5. **End-to-End Test** ❌ (Not implemented yet)
   ```bash
   # Test script to verify complete workflow
   ./tests/test-e2e-workflow.sh
   ```

### Success Criteria
- Scripts execute without errors ✅
- Input validation catches all invalid inputs ✅
- Error handling properly manages failure scenarios ✅
- Certificate generation works for both DEV and PRO environments ✅
- End-to-end workflow successfully creates a project container ⚠️ (Partially implemented - container creation works but deployment is skipped in tests)

**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks  
**Actual Time:** 1 week (core functionality implemented)

   - Implement certificate installation ✅

2. **Implement Local Host Configuration** ✅ (Implemented on 2025-06-23)
   - Create script to update local hosts file ✅
   - Configure local DNS resolution ✅

3. **Implement Development Tooling**
   - Create development-specific Docker Compose overrides
   - Implement hot reload for development

### Tests

1. **Certificate Generation Test** ✅ (Passed on 2025-06-22)
   ```bash
   # Test script to verify certificate generation
   ./tests/test-cert-generation.sh
   ```

2. **Local Host Configuration Test** ✅ (Passed on 2025-06-23)
   ```bash
   # Test script to verify local host configuration
   ./tests/test-local-hosts.sh
