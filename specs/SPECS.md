# Microservices Nginx Architecture - Technical Specifications

This document provides an overview of the technical specifications for the Microservices Nginx Architecture project. Each component has its own detailed specification document linked below.

## Architecture Overview

The Microservices Nginx Architecture is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and maintainable infrastructure for hosting multiple isolated web applications using Nginx and container technology. The system consists of:

1. **Central Nginx Proxy**: A reverse proxy that handles SSL termination, domain routing, and security features
2. **Project Containers**: Isolated containers for each project with their own Nginx instances
3. **Network Isolation**: Separate networks for each project with controlled communication
4. **Automation Scripts**: Comprehensive tooling for deployment and management
5. **Multi-Environment Support**: Development and production environment configurations
6. **Zero-Downtime Operations**: Incremental deployment without service disruption

## Key Components

### 1. Central Nginx Proxy

The central proxy is responsible for:
- SSL/TLS termination
- Domain-based routing
- Security headers and rate limiting
- Bad bot blocking
- HTTP to HTTPS redirection

[Detailed Proxy Specification](nginx-proxy-spec.md)

### 2. Project Containers

Each project container includes:
- Isolated Nginx instance
- Project-specific configuration
- Static file serving
- Health check endpoints
- Security hardening

[Detailed Project Container Specification](project-container-spec.md)

### 3. Network Architecture

The network architecture provides:
- Shared proxy network for routing
- Isolated project networks
- Controlled communication paths
- DNS resolution between containers

[Detailed Architecture Specification](architecture-spec.md)

### 4. Automation Scripts

The automation scripts provide:
- Project creation and deployment
- Certificate management
- Environment configuration
- Proxy integration
- Deployment verification
- Zero-downtime incremental deployment

[Detailed Script Specification](script-spec.md)

### 5. Environment Management

The environment management system supports:
- Development environment with local DNS and self-signed certificates
- Production environment with Cloudflare integration
- Environment-specific configurations
- Seamless switching between environments

[Detailed Environment Specification](environment-spec.md)

### 6. Podman Integration

The Podman integration provides:
- Rootless container operation
- Reliable container networking
- Docker compatibility layer
- Network connectivity testing

[Detailed Podman Specification](podman-specs.md)

### 7. Testing Framework

The testing framework includes:
- Functional testing
- Integration testing
- Security testing
- Performance testing
- Deployment verification

[Detailed Testing Specification](testing-spec.md)

### 8. Cloudflare Integration (Production)

The Cloudflare integration provides:
- CDN capabilities
- Additional security layer
- DNS management
- SSL/TLS configuration

[Detailed Cloudflare Specification](cloudflare-spec.md)

## Technical Requirements

- Detailed logging and error handling

## Implementation Status

The project is currently in **PRODUCTION READY** state with all core features implemented and tested. Recent major achievements include:

1. **Podman Integration**: Complete podman integration for rootless container operation with robust networking
2. **Enterprise Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and specification suite
3. **Script Architecture Fixes**: Fixed critical script architecture issues in the modular project creation system
4. **Incremental Deployment System**: Zero-downtime project addition to a running ecosystem
