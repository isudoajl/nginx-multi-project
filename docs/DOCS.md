## Key Features Documentation

### Zero-Downtime Incremental Deployment

The system supports adding new projects to a running ecosystem without disrupting existing services:

```bash
# Frontend-only incremental deployment
nix --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" develop --command \
./scripts/create-project-modular.sh \
  --name second-app \
  --domain second-app.com \
  --env PRO

# Full-stack incremental deployment
nix --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" develop --command \
./scripts/create-project-modular.sh \
  --name fullstack-app \
  --domain fullstack-app.com \
  --monorepo /path/to/monorepo \
  --frontend-dir frontend \
  --backend-dir backend \
  --env PRO
```

For more details, see the [Deployment Guide](deployment-guide.md).

### Self-Healing Infrastructure

The system includes self-healing capabilities that automatically recover from failure states:

- Automatic proxy detection (running/stopped/missing)
- Self-healing proxy creation from scratch
- Network orchestration and SSL certificate management
- Comprehensive health verification and integration testing

For more details, see the [How It Works](how-it-works.md) document.

### Multi-Environment Support

The system supports both development and production environments:

- Development environment with local DNS and self-signed certificates
- Production environment with Cloudflare integration
- Environment-specific configurations
- Seamless switching between environments

For more details, see the [Deployment Guide](deployment-guide.md).

### Podman Integration

The system includes complete podman integration for rootless container operation:

- Rootless container operation without root privileges
- Container networking with reliable communication
- Docker compatibility layer for seamless transition
- Network connectivity testing

For more details, see the [Podman Integration](podman-integration.md) document.

### Internal Container Networking

The system uses container name-based communication without exposed ports:

- No port conflicts between projects
- Enhanced security through port isolation
- Simplified container management
- Container name-based DNS resolution
- Internal communication without host port exposure

For more details, see the [Project Container Architecture](project-container-architecture.md) document.

### Full-Stack Deployment Support âœ… WORKING

The system now supports comprehensive full-stack deployments with integrated frontend and backend services:

- **âœ… Multi-Framework Backend Support**: Rust, Node.js, Go, Python
- **âœ… Multi-Service Containers**: nginx + backend application server
- **âœ… API Routing**: Automatic `/api/*` â†’ backend proxy configuration **[FIXED]**
- **âœ… Framework Detection**: Automatic build system detection and configuration
- **âœ… Process Management**: Coordinated startup and health monitoring
- **âœ… Monorepo Integration**: Support for existing Nix flake configurations
- **âœ… Frontend-Backend Communication**: Automatic API URL configuration **[NEW]**

**Latest Fixes in Beta Release:**
- **Fixed nginx proxy routing**: `/api/*` requests now correctly reach backend services
- **Automated API configuration**: Templates automatically convert hardcoded URLs to relative paths
- **Production verified**: Real-world testing with mapa-kms project (Rust + React)

Example full-stack deployment:
```bash
nix --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" develop --command \
./scripts/create-project-modular.sh \
  --name my-rust-app \
  --domain my-rust-app.com \
  --monorepo /opt/my-rust-app \
  --frontend-dir frontend \
  --backend-dir backend \
  --backend-port 3000 \
  --env PRO
```
