@IMPLEMENTATION_INTEGRATION.md

What to do:

Create a new branch 

    Study all specs and requirements.

        Look at specs/* (which may include @SPECS.md) for the functional specs.

        Check @.cursor (or any other “.cursor” files) in the whole project structure for low-level/technical requirements.

        Open @IMPLEMENTATION_INTEGRATION.md to see what’s already done and what’s still missing.

    Pick the single most important missing feature and implement it.

        If it’s not implemented yet, write the code.

        Also write tests (unit tests or integration tests) that verify the new feature.

  
        Run the full test suite.

    Update @IMPLEMENTATION_INTEGRATION.md .

        Mark the new feature as “implemented” (add date/test-pass note, etc.).

    Commit and push your changes via Git.

        Commit the code, tests, and the updated @IMPLEMENTATION_INTEGRATION.md.

        Push to the repo or create a pull request.
