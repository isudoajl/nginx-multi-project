# Test Results Summary

## Test Environment
- **Host**: DEV VPS
- **Container Engine**: Podman
- **Project**: test-project
- **Base Image**: nginx:alpine
- **Port Mapping**: 8088:8080

## Test Results

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Project Creation | ✅ Passed | Project structure created successfully |
| Container Build | ✅ Passed | Container built successfully after Dockerfile fixes |
| Container Start | ❌ Failed | Container fails to start due to configuration issues |
| Configuration Validation | ❌ Failed | NGINX configuration has syntax errors |
| Port Binding | ❌ Failed | Cannot bind to privileged ports as non-root |
| Log File Access | ❌ Failed | Permission denied for log files |
| Cache Directory Access | ❌ Failed | Permission denied for cache directories |

## Error Summary

1. **Permission Issues**:
   - Cannot write to log files
   - Cannot create cache directories
   - Cannot bind to privileged ports

2. **Configuration Issues**:
   - Invalid directive contexts
   - Incorrect use of `if` statements

3. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Rootlessport conflicts with existing services

## Test Artifacts

- **Container Logs**: Captured and analyzed
- **Configuration Files**: Modified to address issues
- **Technical Reports**: Created for documentation

## Conclusion

The test project deployment was not successful due to multiple issues related to permissions, configuration, and port binding. The main blockers are:

1. Running NGINX as a non-root user in a containerized environment requires special configuration
2. NGINX configuration has strict syntax rules that must be followed
3. Port binding below 1024 requires root privileges

The recommended approach is to:

1. Simplify the NGINX configuration
2. Use non-privileged ports
3. Configure logging to stdout/stderr
4. Use /tmp for temporary files
5. Consider running as root within the container for development purposes
