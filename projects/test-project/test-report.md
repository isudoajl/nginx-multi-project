# Test Project Implementation Report

## Overview
This report documents the process of creating and configuring the test-project in the nginx-multi-project environment, including challenges encountered and solutions implemented.

## Actions Performed

### 1. Project Creation
- Used `create-project.sh` script to create a new test project
- Command: `./scripts/create-project.sh --name test-project --port 8080 --domain test-project.local --env DEV`

### 2. Initial Configuration Issues
- Initial Dockerfile had issues with nginx user creation (user already existed in base image)
- Modified Dockerfile to remove redundant user creation

### 3. Permission Issues
- Container failed to start due to permission issues with log files
- Error: `nginx: [alert] could not open error log file: open() "/var/log/nginx/error.log" failed (13: Permission denied)`
- Modified Dockerfile to set proper permissions for log directories
- Added commands to create and set permissions for log files

### 4. Cache Directory Issues
- Container failed with error: `mkdir() "/var/cache/nginx/client_temp" failed (13: Permission denied)`
- Added commands to create and set permissions for cache directories
- Modified nginx.conf to use /tmp for cache directories

### 5. Port Binding Issues
- Container failed with error: `bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (13: Permission denied)`
- Changed nginx configuration to use port 8080 instead of 80
- Updated Dockerfile to expose port 8080
- Updated docker-compose.yml to map port 8088 on host to 8080 in container

### 6. NGINX Configuration Issues
- Error: `"if" directive is not allowed here in /etc/nginx/conf.d/server-security.conf:8`
- Removed problematic security.conf file that contained invalid directives
- Created simplified configuration without problematic directives

### 7. Port Conflict Issues
- Error: `rootlessport conflict with ID 1`
- Changed host port mapping from 8080 to 8088 to avoid conflicts

## Current Status
The container is still experiencing configuration issues related to NGINX directives. Further troubleshooting is needed to resolve the following issues:

1. Permission problems with log files
2. Invalid NGINX configuration directives
3. Port binding issues in rootless container environment

## Recommendations
1. Simplify the NGINX configuration further
2. Use a non-privileged port (>1024) for the container
3. Configure logging to stdout/stderr instead of files
4. Use volume mounts with proper permissions for persistent storage
5. Consider using a custom NGINX image with proper permissions pre-configured
