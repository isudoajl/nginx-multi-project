# Technical Analysis: NGINX Container Issues

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Permission Issues

#### Problem
The container runs NGINX as a non-root user but attempts to write to locations that require root privileges:
- `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
- `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
- `/var/cache/nginx/client_temp`

#### Technical Details
- In a rootless container environment, processes run with limited privileges
- Standard paths like `/var/log` and `/var/cache` often require root permissions
- The nginx:alpine image expects to run as root by default

#### Solution Attempts
1. Modified Dockerfile to create directories and set permissions:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN chown -R nginx:nginx /var/log/nginx \
       && chmod -R 755 /var/log/nginx
   ```

2. Redirected logs to stdout/stderr:
   ```nginx
   error_log  /dev/stderr notice;
   access_log  /dev/stdout  main;
   ```

3. Used /tmp for cache directories:
   ```nginx
   client_body_temp_path /tmp/client_temp;
   proxy_temp_path       /tmp/proxy_temp;
   fastcgi_temp_path     /tmp/fastcgi_temp;
   uwsgi_temp_path       /tmp/uwsgi_temp;
   scgi_temp_path        /tmp/scgi_temp;
   ```

### 2. Port Binding Issues

#### Problem
Non-root users cannot bind to privileged ports (below 1024):
- Error: `bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (13: Permission denied)`

#### Technical Details
- Only root can bind to ports below 1024 in Linux
- In rootless containers, even if the container thinks it's running as root, the host sees it as an unprivileged user

#### Solution Attempts
1. Changed NGINX to listen on port 8080 instead of 80:
   ```nginx
   listen 8080 default_server;
   listen [::]:8080 default_server;
   ```

2. Updated port mapping in docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "8088:8080"
   ```

### 3. NGINX Configuration Issues

#### Problem
Invalid NGINX configuration directives:
- Error: `"if" directive is not allowed here in /etc/nginx/conf.d/server-security.conf:8`

#### Technical Details
- NGINX has strict context rules for directives
- `if` directives are only allowed in specific contexts (location, server)
- The security.conf file had `if` directives in the wrong context

#### Solution Attempts
1. Removed problematic security.conf file
2. Attempted to move `if` directives to proper location contexts
3. Simplified configuration to focus on core functionality

## Lessons Learned

1. **Container User Context**: When running containers as non-root users, standard paths need to be adjusted
2. **NGINX Configuration**: NGINX has strict rules about directive contexts that must be followed
3. **Port Binding**: Use ports above 1024 for non-root containers
4. **Logging Strategy**: Direct logs to stdout/stderr for containerized applications
5. **Volume Management**: Use proper volume mounts with appropriate permissions

## Future Improvements

1. Create a custom base image with proper permissions pre-configured
2. Implement a more modular NGINX configuration approach
3. Use NGINX Unit instead of NGINX for better containerization support
4. Implement a health check that validates configuration before starting
5. Create automated tests for container configuration
